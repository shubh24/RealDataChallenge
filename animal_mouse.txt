A mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse. This is attributable both to breeding and to different conditions in the wild. The most well known strain, the white lab mouse, has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research.The American white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), as well as other common species of mouse-like rodents around the world, also sometimes live in houses. These, however, are in other genera.Cats, wild dogs, foxes, birds of prey, snakes and even certain kinds of arthropods have been known to prey heavily upon mice. Nevertheless, because of its remarkable adaptability to almost any environment, the mouse is one of the most successful mammalian genera living on Earth today.Mice can at times be vermin, damaging and eating crops,[1] causing structural damage and spreading diseases through their parasites and feces.[2] In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus, which may lead to Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS).Primarily nocturnal[3][4] animals, mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen sense of hearing, and rely especially on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid predators.[5]Mice build intricate burrows in the wild. These burrows typically have long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels/routes. In at least one species, the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait.[6]Contents  [hide] 1	Reproduction2	Laboratory mice3	Subgenera4	As pets5	Diet6	As food7	Use for sense of smell8	See also9	References10	External linksReproduction1 day old pupsBreeding onset is at about 50 days of age in both females and males, although females may have their first estrus at 25–40 days. Mice are polyestrous and breed year round; ovulation is spontaneous. The duration of the estrous cycle is 4–5 days and estrus itself lasts about 12 hours, occurring in the evening. Vaginal smears are useful in timed matings to determine the stage of the estrous cycle. Mating is usually nocturnal and may be confirmed by the presence of a copulatory plug in the vagina up to 24 hours post-copulation. The presence of sperm on a vaginal smear is also a reliable indicator of mating.[7]Female mice housed together tend to go into anestrus and do not cycle. If exposed to a male mouse or the pheromones of a male mouse, most of the females will go into estrus in about 72 hours. This synchronization of the estrous cycle is known as the Whitten effect. The exposure of a recently bred mouse to the pheromones of a strange male mouse may prevent implantation (or pseudopregnancy), a phenomenon known as the Bruce effect.[7]The average gestation period is 20 days. A fertile postpartum estrus occurs 14–24 hours following parturition, and simultaneous lactation and gestation prolongs gestation 3–10 days owing to delayed implantation. The average litter size is 10–12 during optimum production, but is highly strain-dependent. As a general rule, inbred mice tend to have longer gestation periods and smaller litters than outbred and hybrid mice. The young are called pups and weigh 0.5–1.5 g (0.018–0.053 oz) at birth, are hairless, and have closed eyelids and ears. Cannibalism is uncommon, but females should not be disturbed during parturition and for at least 2 days postpartum. Pups are weaned at 3 weeks of age; weaning weight is 10–12 g (0.35–0.42 oz). If the postpartum estrus is not utilized, the female resumes cycling 2–5 days post-weaning.[7]Newborn male mice are distinguished from newborn females by noting the greater anogenital distance and larger genital papilla in the male. This is best accomplished by lifting the tails of littermates and comparing perineums.[7]Laboratory miceMain article: Laboratory mouseKnockout miceMice are common experimental animals in laboratory research of biology and psychology fields primarily because they are mammals, and also because they share a high degree of homology with humans. They are the most commonly used mammalian model organism, more common than rats. The mouse genome has been sequenced, and virtually all mouse genes have human homologs. They can also be manipulated in ways that are illegal with humans, although animal rights activitsts often object. A knockout mouse is a genetically engineered mouse that has had one or more of its genes made inoperable through a gene knockout.Reasons for common selection of mice are small size, inexpensive, widely varied diet, easily maintained, and can reproduce quickly. Several generations of mice can be observed in a relatively short period of time. Mice are generally very docile if raised from birth and given sufficient human contact. However, certain strains have been known to be quite temperamental. Mice and rats have the same organs in the same places, with the difference of size.SubgeneraField mouse of the subgenus Mus.All members of the Mus genus are referred to as mice. However, the term mouse can also be applied to species outside of this genus. Mouse often refers to any small muroid rodent, while rat refers to larger muroid rodents. Therefore, these terms are not taxonomically specific. For simplicity, only the rodent subgenera belonging to the Mus genus are listed here.Genus Mus - Typical miceSubgenus Coelomys (East Asia)Subgenus Mus (Eurasia to North Africa, except for the house mouse which is worldwide.)Subgenus Nannomys (Sub-Saharan Africa)Subgenus Pyromys (East Asia)Subgenus and species Mus lepidoidesAs petsPet miceMain article: Fancy mouseMany people buy mice as companion pets. They can be playful, loving and can grow used to being handled. Like pet rats, pet mice should not be left unsupervised outside as they have many natural predators, including (but not limited to) birds, snakes, lizards, cats, and dogs. Male mice tend to have a stronger odor than the females. However, mice are careful groomers and as pets they never need bathing. Well looked-after mice can make ideal pets. Some common mouse care products are:Ganesh sits affectionately with his vahana, MushikaCage – Usually a hamster or gerbil cage, but a variety of special mouse cages are now available. Most should have a secure door.[8]Food – Special pelleted and seed-based food is available. Mice can generally eat most rodent food (for rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, etc.)Bedding – Usually made of hardwood pulp, such as aspen, sometimes from shredded, uninked paper or recycled virgin wood pulp. Using corn husk bedding is avoided because it promotes Aspergillus fungus, and can grow mold once it gets wet, which is rough on their feet.DietIn nature, mice are largely herbivores, consuming any kind of fruit or grain from plants.[9] However, mice adapt well to urban areas and are known for eating almost all types of food scraps. In captivity, mice are commonly fed commercial pelleted mouse diet. These diets are nutritionally complete, but they still need a large variety of vegetables. Food intake is approximately 15 g (0.53 oz) per 100 g (3.5 oz) of body weight per day; water intake is approximately 15 ml (0.53 imp fl oz; 0.51 US fl oz) per 100 g of body weight per day.[7]As food\"Pinkie\" mice for sale as reptile foodMice are a staple in the diet of many small carnivores. Humans have eaten mice since prehistoric times and still eat them as a delicacy throughout eastern Zambia and northern Malawi,[10] where they are a seasonal source of protein. Mice are no longer routinely consumed by humans elsewhere.In various countries mice are used as food[11] for pets such as snakes, lizards, frogs, tarantulas and birds of prey, and many pet stores carry mice for this purpose. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, have banned the practice of feeding live mice, citing ethical concerns regarding both predator and prey.[citation needed]Common terms used to refer to different ages/sizes of mice when sold for pet food are \"pinkies\", \"fuzzies\", \"crawlers\", \"hoppers\", and \"adults\".[12] Pinkies are newborn mice that have not yet grown fur; fuzzies have some fur but are not very mobile; hoppers have a full coat of hair and are fully mobile but are smaller than adult mice. Mice without fur are easier for the animal to consume; however, mice with fur may be more convincing as animal feed. These terms are also used to refer to the various growth stages of rats (see Fancy rat).Use for sense of smellIsraeli scientists have tested mice as a new form of airport security detector. It consists of three concealed cartridges, each containing eight specially trained mice. If they sense traces of explosives or drugs, they will trigger the alarm. According to the New Scientist, the mice work four-hour shifts and are more accurate than using dogs or X-ray machines.[13]A kangaroo mouse is either one of the two species of jumping mouse (genus Microdipodops) native to the deserts of the southwestern United States, predominantly found in the state of Nevada. The name \"kangaroo mouse\" refers to the species\' extraordinary jumping ability, as well as its habit of bipedal locomotion. The two species are:Pale kangaroo mouse - Microdipodops pallidusDark kangaroo mouse - Microdipodops megacephalusBoth species of kangaroo mouse live in sandy desert ecosystems, and forage for seeds and vegetation amongst the scrub brush of their native habitat. The dark kangaroo mouse is also known to feed occasionally on insects and carrion. The mouse never drinks water, instead deriving it metabolically from the foods it eats. The kangaroo mouse collects food and maintains large caches in their burrows, which are excavated to a length of between 3 and 8 feet (1 to 2.5 meters). The burrow, the entrance to which the mouse covers during daylight hours, is also used to raise litters of between 2 and 7 young. The pale kangaroo mouse burrows only in fine sand, while the dark kangaroo mouse prefers fine, gravelly soils but may also burrow in sand or sandy soil. Kangaroo mice are nocturnal, and are most active in the two hours following sunset. They are believed to hibernate during cold weather.The kangaroo mice are closely related to the kangaroo rats, which belong to the same subfamily, Dipodomyinae.The kangaroo mouse features significantly in the best-selling science fiction novel Dune. The protagonist, Paul Atreides, is called Muad\'Dib, a fremen word for kangaroo mouse.The brush mouse (Peromyscus boylii) is a species of rodents in the family Cricetidae. It is found in mountainous areas of Mexico and the western United States at altitudes over 2,000 m (6,600 ft).[1]Contents  [hide] 1	Description2	Distribution and habitat2.1	Subspecies3	Density and home range4	Cover requirements5	Plant communities5.1	California5.2	Arizona5.3	New Mexico6	Timing of major life events7	Food habits8	Predators9	References10	Further reading11	External linksDescription[edit]The brush mouse is medium-sized, with small ears and a long tail. It has yellowish-brown fur on the body, with slate grey under parts. The tail has only sparse hair for most of its length, but with a distinct brush-like tuft of hair at the tip (although the common name is, perhaps, more likely to come from brushy environment in which it lives). It has a head-body length of 86 to 105 mm (3.4 to 4.1 in) with a tail 88 to 115 mm (3.5 to 4.5 in) long. It is very similar in appearance to a number of closely related species of mouse living in the same area, although it can be distinguished from them by such features as the length of its tail, the size of its ears, and the presence of the tuft on the end of the tail.[2]Distribution and habitat[edit]The brush mouse can be found from northern California to eastern Colorado and western Texas, and south to Baja California and southern Mexico.[3] Fossils of brush mice up to 35,000 years old have been discovered, but none have been definitively identified from outside the current range of the species.[2]Vegetation in brush mouse habitats may vary from location to location, but brush mice are consistently captured in areas with medium to high densities of shrubs and tree cover under 16 ft (5 m) in height.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] In California, mature chaparral (cover ≥50%) appears to provide more suitable habitat for brush mice than young, open chaparral (cover <50%).[8] Similarly, in Arizona, Duran [5] captured brush mice most frequently in shrub live oak and birchleaf mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides) understory habitats with 45% to 50% plant cover. Fewer brush mice were captured in habitats with less plant cover.[5] Holbrook [12] observed that after vegetation crowns were removed in a manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.)-oak shrubland, brush mice avoided the newly opened space. In another study, brush mice were strongly restricted to habitats in which gaps between rocks or ceanothus (Ceanothus spp.) on the site were less than 4 ft (1.2 m).[13]In addition to shrub density, the height of cover appears to influence brush mouse distribution within a site. An average understory height of 5.0–6.5 feet (1.5–2.0 m) was preferred by brush mice over lower understory cover.[14] In another study, brush mouse presence was positively correlated with microhabitats of shrub cover up to 10 feet (3 m) tall, logs over 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter, and understory trees 10–33 feet (3–10 m) in height, but negatively correlated with grass-forb microhabitats.[15]Brush mice are also commonly captured at locations with high proportions of rock cover and/or slash piles in habitats characterized by chaparral-mountain shrub, oak/shrub, oak-juniper-pinyon pine, juniper-pinyon pine, and oak-pine communities, as well as riparian habitats.[4][6][7][9][10][11][16][17][18][19][20][21] The brush mouse in Texas has been found in all major habitats present (desert, grassland, riparian, and montane), although it is typically associated with rock outcrops within these habitats.[4] Riparian sites with abundant brush mouse populations had high shrub cover, high frequency of debris piles with low grass, litter, and tree cover.[22] In a Mexico study, a canyon was dominated by exposed rock, grasses, pines, hardwoods, and brush.[16] In West Texas, brush mice favored fallen logs and brush piles.[23] Modi [24] discovered that brush mice were common in riparian zones dominated by pecan (Carya illinoensis), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and live oak (Quercus virginiana), in an oak community with a partially open canopy and dense understory, and in a pine forest with little understory and scattered boulders. In New Mexico, brush mouse populations were significantly (P<0.05) higher on sites that were bulldozed or thinned (98 and 115 captures, respectively) than untreated or bulldozed and burned sites.[25] Populations were lowest on sites that had not been treated (45 captures). Sites that had increased slash from bulldozing and burning had more brush mice (57 captures) than the untreated sites, but the difference was not significant (P>0.05). No influence of canopy cover on brush mice was observed by Severson et al..[25]Besides high tree, shrub, and rock densities, brush mice appear to prefer locations with low grass cover.[13][22] At the same time, grasses are often present in the understory indicating that grasses do not exclude brush mice.[4][18] Brush mice used grazed and ungrazed pastures and ceanothus plots,[13] but they were concentrated around rocky outcrops and vegetation continuous with the rock outcrops. No brush mice were captured in the grasslands more than 20 ft (6 m) from rocks, shrubs, or trees.[13] Litter depth also appears negatively correlated to brush mouse presence.[10][14] For instance, brush mice in Arizona were captured in litter depths of only 0.9 inches (2.4 cm).[10]Brush mice also use fire-affected habitats. In one study, brush mice were captured in burned and unburned chaparral, as well as burned and unburned pine-oak forest. The highest number of captures were recorded in unburned forest, while the lowest captures occurred in the unburned chaparral.[7] These results are somewhat inconsistent with other observations which show the brush mouse favoring dense chaparral habitat. Small mammal capture data in the study were collected from 14 months to three years after fire.[7] The time frame of sampling after fire may influence the perceived response of the brush mouse to burned habitats.Elevation, in addition to habitat characteristics, may play a role in habitat suitability in some areas. For instance, in the northern Sierra Nevada of California, brush mice were captured in brush habitats at 3,500–5,000 ft (1,000–1,500 m), but not at 6,500 ft (2,000 m).[26] Aspect may influence the distribution of brush mice on a site, as well. For example, in New Mexico, 51% of all brush mice captured were taken on south-facing slopes, 24% on west-facing slopes, with 13% and 12% of mice captured on east- and north-facing slopes, respectively.[11] The south-facing canyon slopes may provide more cover for brush mice due to higher numbers of shrubs.[11]Although brush mice are found on a variety of slopes, including flat mesas and gradual slopes, they seem to prefer locations with very steep slopes, such as hillsides, mountainsides, and canyons (including some slopes with >45% gradient) over more gradual slopes in the same areas.[7][14][16][18][19] Findley [27] reported that brush mice were captured on hillsides in an oak/sacahuista (Nolina spp.) community. In another study, brush mice were common in canyon bottoms, on hillsides, and in arroyos (water channels in arid regions) characterized by oak woodlands.[28] Brush mice have also been captured along the sides of brush covered canyons and burned slopes of an oak/brush association.[11]Subspecies[edit]Four subspecies of brush mouse are currently identified:[2]P. b. boylii – northern CaliforniaP. b. glasselli – San Pedro Nolasco IslandP. b. rowleyi – remainder of rangeP. b. utahensis – central UtahDensity and home range[edit]Brush mouse population densities were 40–72 mice per hectare in coastal California.[29] discovered Similarly, densities of brush mice in coastal California were 42–89 mice per hectare.[30] Densities appear t be greatly influenced by weather. Densities were 17–20 per acre one year, but were reduced to six mice per acre following a severe winter.[19] At another study site, brush mice increased from four individuals per acre to 12 per acre after a mild winter.[19] Populations in a canyon in Mexico were estimated at a mean of 10.8 brush mice per acre or 6.0 males and 4.8 females per acre.[16] The range was 9–14 brush mice per acre.[16]A study using radiotelemetry and trapping data in Arizona estimated mean home range size for male brush mice at 0.72–1.6 acres (0.29–0.64 hectare), and 0.32–0.79 acre (0.13–0.32 hectare) for females.[31] In another study at the same location, home ranges for male brush mice ranged from means of 1.2–1.5 acres (0.47–0.62 hectare) and for females, means of 0.64–1.2 acres (0.26–0.49 hectare).[32] Mean home range for male and female brush mice in Arizona, based on radiotelemetry, was 0.30 acre (0.12 hectare).[33]Cover requirements[edit]No significant differences in habitat use between genders were observed in Arizona.[34] Typical habitat in southern Arizona was characterized by 74% tree cover, 60% leaf cover, 21% shrub cover, and 16% rock cover. Additionally, 67% of all brush mice relocated by radiotelemetry in the study were located in a riparian zone with the other observations occurring in uplands and an intermittent stream channel. Brush mice used sites with significantly (P<0.05) more rock cover (19% to 22%) during winter and spring than at other times of the year. Also in spring, plots with the most brush mice also had significantly (P<0.05) more shrub cover (21% vs.14%) and succulents (9% vs. 2%) than random plots.[34]In a New Mexico study, 27% of brush mice captured were taken around rocky areas, 10% under Gambel oak (Q. gambelii), 9% under juniper, and 7% each around woodpiles and sacahuista.[11] Less frequently, brush mice were taken under or around pinyon pine, gray oak (Q. grisea), Apache plume, rabbitbrush, mountain-mahogany, white fir (Abies concolor), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), locust (Robinia spp.), prickly pear, cholla (Opuntia spp.), chokecherry (Prunus spp.), bricklebush (Brickellia spp.), and grape (Vitis spp.).[11]In southern California, brush mice were captured on leaf mold in an oak hardwood association of coast live oak, white alder (Alnus rhombifolia), whiteflower currant, and sumac (Rhus spp.).[21] They were also trapped under logs and dense vegetation and on wet seepage slopes next to a creek.[21] In coastal California, brush mice were captured primarily under coast live oak, false-willow (Baccharis douglasii), California buckeye, and California bay.[30]Fallen logs and rock outcrops provide nest sites for the brush mouse.[35] They may also construct nests in tree hollows and underground burrows.[36] Brush mice living in mine shafts or caves build nests similar to those of goldfinches.[6] Davis [23] noted that the brush mouse nest is a \"globular structure\" and is constructed primarily of dried grasses within natural cavities. Brush mouse nest sites in California were found on sites with a high density coast live oak (Q. agrifolia) overstory and an open understory with low vegetation and ground cover.[29]Plant communities[edit]California[edit]In California, overstory associates include gray pine (Pinus sabiniana) and California buckeye (Aesculus californica).[14] Understory and other herbaceous species include bulrushes (Scirpus spp.), fourwing saltbrush (Atriplex canescens), and rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus). Whiteflower currant (Ribes indecorum), California bay (Umbellularia californica), black sage (Salvia mellifera), laurel sumac (Malosma laurina), and deerweed (Lotus scoparius) may also be present.[21][37][38][39] Understories may also include exotic annual forbs and grasses such as mustard (Brassica spp.), oats (Avena spp.), and brome (Bromus spp.).[39]Arizona[edit]In Arizona, overstories where brush mice are found are characterized by desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii), and shrub live oak (Quercus turbinella).[15][22] Shrub associates include evergreen sumac (Rhus virens), skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata), roundleaf snowberry (Symphoricarpos rotundifolius), New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana), common hoptree (Ptelea trifoliata), fendlerbush (Fendlera rupicola), Carruth\'s sagewort (Artemisia carruthii), catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), red barberry (Mahonia haematocarpa), netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), and wait-a-minute (Mimosa aculeaticarpa var. biuncifera).[22][40] Herbaceous and succulent species in brush mouse habitats include Wheeler sotol (Dasylirion wheeleri), sacahuista (Nolina microcarpa), Palmer agave (Agave palmeri), goldenrod (Solidago spp.), lupine (Lupinus spp.), prickly-pear (Opuntia spp.), and ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens).[22][40] Grasses found in brush mouse habitat include Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana), bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), and other annual and perennial bunchgrasses.[15][22][40]New Mexico[edit]New Mexico habitats are characterized by rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), fourwing saltbrush, common hoptree and crispleaf buckwheat (Eriogonum corymbosum) in addition to a pinyon-juniper-mountain-mahogany (Pinus-Juniperus-Cercocarpus spp.) overstory.[41] Texas plant associates include Pinchot juniper (Juniperus pinchotii), algerita (Mahonia trifoliolata), clapweed (Ephedra antisyphilitica), featherplume (Dalea formosa), and prickly-pear (Opuntia spp.).[17]Timing of major life events[edit]Brush mice are nocturnal.[5][23][37][42][43] Brush mice appear to limit activity during cooler months in the Sierra Nevada of California,[43] although they are not known to hibernate or enter torpor.[36] In southern areas, such as Arizona, Texas, and northern Mexico, brush mice are active year-round.[4][6][17][23][44]Brush mice reach sexual maturity at 12–19 weeks.[45] However, female brush mice may reach sexual maturity in about five to 9 weeks.[46] In Arizona, females born in late May or June were found pregnant during August of the same year.[6] In West Texas, Arizona, southern Utah, and Mexico, breeding appears to occur nearly year-round.[4][6][17][20][44] However, in northern California, breeding in brush mice peaked twice each year, once in late spring and again in late summer.[47] This result may be related to food availability.[47][48]Female brush mice carry one to six embryos each,[6][20][35][43][47] with three or four embryos being most common.[6][35][47] Lactating females may become pregnant,[6] although lactation may slow the development of embryos in Peromyscus species. The gestation period of the brush mouse is around 23 days.[35] Females may have multiple litters per year.[4][35] The time between litters is likely similar to other Peromyscus species, 25–31 days.[43] Young are weaned at three to four weeks of age.[35]Brush mice have a promiscuous mating system.[29][32] Four of seven litters in a California study were fathered by several males.[29] Males and females did not share nests, and mating pairs did not remain together for long periods of time.[29]Few Peromyscus spp. mice live longer than six months in the wild, but individuals may live up to five years in captivity.[49]Food habits[edit]Brush mice are semiarboreal and can be found foraging in shrubs and trees for leaves and fruits.[27][48] Females were captured more often than males foraging in canyon live oaks (Q. chrysolepis).[38] The individuals with the longest tails appear to spend more time climbing than those with shorter tails.[27]Acorns are commonly eaten by brush mice wherever they are available.[23][29][35][37] Arthropods and cutworms (Protorthodes rufula) are also eaten throughout the year.[5][19][37][41][48] A variety of fruits and seeds from Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), pinyon, California buckeye, manzanita (A. patula and A. viscida), silktassel (Garrya spp.), oneseed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), hackberries (Celtis spp.), New Mexico groundsel (Senecio neomexicanus var. neomexicanus), trailing fleabane (Erigeron flagellaris), annual sunflower (Helianthus annuus), broom snakeweed, common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), western yarrow (Achillea millefolium), white sweetclover (Melilotus albus), threenerve goldenrod (Solidago velutina), prickly-pear, desert wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) are eaten throughout the year when available.[5][19][23][29][35][37][41][48] Other plant parts, such as leaves, stems, flowers, pollen cones, and new sprouts are typically eaten in lower quantities than other foods.[5][19][37][41][48] Fungi are typically consumed when other foods are scarce.[37][48] Infrequently, stomach contents of brush mice contained pieces of mammals, birds, and fence lizards (Sceloporus spp.).[37]Brush mice have been observed caching pinyon pine seeds.[50][51] This observation suggests the brush mouse may play a role in seed dispersal for some plant species.Predators[edit]Predators of the brush mouse include birds of prey such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and spotted owl (Strix occidentalis).[42][43][52][53] Potential mammalian predators may include the coyote (Canis latrans), common gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), swift fox (Vulpes velox), ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), American marten (Martes americana), fisher (Martes pennanti), ermine (Mustela erminea), long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), hooded skunk (Mephitis macroura), white-backed hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus leuconotus), northern raccoon (Procyon lotor), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis).[17][42][43][54] Snakes also prey on brush mice.[43][55]The wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) is a common murid rodent from Europe and northwestern Africa. It is closely related to the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) but differs in that it has no band of yellow fur around the neck, has slightly smaller ears, and is usually slightly smaller overall: around 90 mm (3.54\") in length. It is found across most of Europe and is a very common and widespread species, is commensal with people and is sometimes considered a pest.[1] Other common names are long-tailed field mouse, field mouse, common field mouse, and European wood mouse.[2]Upper front teeth with smooth inner surface which distinguish the wood mouse from the house mouseContents  [hide] 1	Habitat2	Behaviour3	Reproduction4	Gallery5	References6	External linksHabitat[edit]\"Harvest, Wood Mouse\" illustration from \"British Mammals\" by A. Thorburn, 1920Wood mice inhabit forests, grasslands, and cultivated fields. Almost entirely nocturnal and terrestrial, wood mice burrow extensively, build nests of plants and live in buildings during harsh seasons. It is one of the most intensively studied species in the genus. In Europe it ranges north to Scandinavia and east to Ukraine. The wood mouse is also found in northwestern Africa and on many Mediterranean islands.[3]Behaviour[edit]Wood mice are primarily seed eaters,[4] particularly seeds of trees such as oak, beech, ash, lime, hawthorn, and sycamore. If seeds are plentiful on the ground, they carry them back to their nests/burrows for storage. They may eat small invertebrates such as snails and insects, particularly in late spring and early summer when seeds are least available. They also consume berries, fruits, and roots. During the colder months, wood mice do not hibernate; however, during severe winter seasons they fall into a sort of torpor, a decrease in physiological activity. They are mainly active during the dark, and are very good climbers. While foraging, wood mice pick up and distribute visually conspicuous objects, such as leaves and twigs, which they then use as landmarks during exploration.[5] If a wood mouse is caught by its tail, it can quickly shed the end of it, which may never regrow.[6] Despite its name, it prefers hedgerows to woodland. To prevent predation, wood mice tend to forage in covered microsites.[7]Reproduction[edit]The wood mouse has a breeding season from February to October in which multiple matings occur between males and females, resulting in scramble competition. Such behavioral characteristics result in sperm competition and multiple paternity litters. The society is polygynous with copulation resulting from scramble competition during reproductive periods. Males possess a sac known as the cauda epididymis, which stores sperm and lies underneath the scrotal protrusion. Temperature regulation ensures maximum sperm output.One interesting observation about the species, in particular the males, is the morphology of the spermatozoa. They develop falciform (sickle-shaped) heads after meiosis and before spermiation (release during ejaculation). The hook located at the tip of the head adheres to the surface of the head prior to deployment. Propidium iodide staining revealed that only the basal surface of the hook is of nuclear origin.[8] These apical hooks are deployed in female reproductive tract (mechanism responsible involved the remodeling of actin filaments in the hook).[8] Deployed apical hooks combine with apical hooks and flagella of other spermatozoa. The aggregates of spermatozoa that result form \"mobile trains\", which have experimentally been determined to possess better motility in the female reproductive tract.[8] The mobility of these mobile trains was also found to be influenced by premature acrosome reactions, altruistic acts performed by some spermatozoa for the benefit of other genetically similar gametocytes. This altruism follows a \"green beard\" mechanism in which spermatozoa discern the genetic similarity of surrounding gametocytes (such mechanisms are rare because they must code for a recognizable phenotype, as well as response mechanisms). Once spermatozoa of similar genotypes are identified, altruism genes are turned on to elicit a response that seeks to conserve the genes present in the other cell, even if it results in the destruction of the cell performing the action.The gestation period of wood mice is of 25–26 days and each female produces on average five young. The offspring become independent after about three weeks and become sexually active after two months.The large Mindoro forest mouse (Apomys gracilirostris) is a species of rodent in the family Muridae, from the genus Apomys. It is found only in the Philippines. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is a large mouse with large feet, a long tail and an elongated snout which is morphologically unique within its genus. It is covered in soft fur which is mostly dark brown in colour. Its closest relative is thought to be the Luzon montane forest mouse, based on genetic and morphological similarities.Contents  [hide] 1	Discovery and taxonomy2	Identification3	Evolution and phylogenetic relationships4	Ecology and behaviour5	References6	BibliographyDiscovery and taxonomy[edit]In May and June 1992, an expedition to the Philippines was organised for the purpose of increasing the knowledge on their biodiversity. During this expedition, sixteen examples of a then unknown species of mouse were captured on Mount Halcon, on the island Mindoro. To this day, these animals, all captured between May 28 and June 12, 1992, remain the only known specimens of this species.In 1995, in the scientific journal Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, biologist Luis A. Ruedas described the animal as Apomys gracilirostris. At the time it was the ninth known species of the endemic Filipino genus Apomys, and the second found on Mindoro, after Apomys musculus (least forest mouse). The editors of a compilation work on the indigenous mammals of the Philippines accepted the animal as a new species in 1998.[1]A. gracilirostris was the first newly described Apomys since 1962, when Apomys sacobianus (long-nosed Luzon forest mouse) was described. However, it was far from being the only new species discovered in the Philippines. Several new rodents had already been discovered in the eighties, one of which was actually from Mindoro as well (Anonymomys mindorensis or Mindoro climbing rat). A constant supply of new species remained in the years after the description of A. gracilirostris. In ten years time, eight new mammal species were added to the list.[2] In 2006, another new Apomys was described: Apomys camiguinensis (Camiguin forest mouse). Apomys also comprises several species which are yet undescribed, two of which are from Mindoro. Another species from Mindoro, from the predominantly Indonesian genus Maxomys, has yet to receive its scientific name.[3]In accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the name Apomys gracilirostris is a binomen. The generic name, Apomys was proposed by American biologist Edgar Mearns in 1905 and has the meaning of \"mouse from Mount Apo\" (mys, μῦς, being the Ancient Greek word for \"mouse\"); this because the type species of the genus was first found on Mount Apo. The specific name, gracilirostris, is a combination of the Latin words gracilis \"slender\" and rostrum \"snout\" and refers to the animal\'s long, slender snout.Identification[edit]The genus Apomys, of which the large Mindoro forest mouse is a member, can be identified by its small size, a long tail, elongate, narrow hind feet, the presence of four abdominal mammary glands, and a large number of skull characteristics. Within this genus, the large Mindoro forest mouse has several specific identifying features, the most important of which are its very thin and short upper incisors, long lower incisors and long snout. The tail and feet are also relatively long, even within the genus Apomys. The characteristics of the incisors are so peculiar that when Ruedas discovered the species, he initially thought he had found a new genus.[4]Table 1. Measurements of Apomys gracilirostris.Measurement	Holotype	Females[5](four specimens)	Males[5](thirteen specimens)Total length (mm)	294	306 ± 23 (283–330)	314 ± 31 (288–398)Tail length (mm)	157	161 ± 13 (147–175)	159 ± 15 (135–185)Hind foot length (mm)	39	37 ± 4 (33–41)	39 ± 3 (34–45)Ear length (mm)	21	19.2 ± 1.3 (18–21)	19 ± 3 (14–22)Weight (g)	80	89 ± 18 (75–115)	87 ± 18 (71–140)The fur of the large Mindoro forest mouse is soft and smooth. The hairs of the dorsal fur are light gray near the root, and dark brown at the tip. Between the normal hairs are many black tactile hairs. This makes the dorsal fur appear dark brown, although recently captured animals have a dark blue-green hue. Some animals are darker around the midline of the back, and all are a lighter colour at the flanks. The colour of the ventral fur varies between animals, with it being a yellow-brown colour in some, slightly lighter coloured than the dorsal fur in others, still others having gray hairs with brown or silver-coloured tips in the ventral fur, and finally some animals showing no difference between the dorsal and ventral fur at all.[4]The tail is usually an even, dark colour, but in some animals the ventral side is somewhat darker. In some animals the tail ends in a white tip of 2 to 10 mm in length. The tail has fourteen scales per centimeter. The long, dark hind feet end in long claws (about 4 mm). The claws on the front feet are about 3 mm in length. The animal has seven cervical vertebrae, thirteen thoracic vertebrae, six lumbar vertebrae, three sacral vertebrae and thirty-two to thirty-five caudal vertebrae.[4]Evolution and phylogenetic relationships[edit]The large Mindoro forest mouse belongs to the Chrotomys division, a group within the Murinae that occurs exclusively on the Philippines and in addition to Apomys also includes Rhynchomys, Chrotomys and Archboldomys. Animals in this division share several morphological[6] and genetic[7] features. Within this group, Apomys is by far the biggest and most extensive genus, containing small, inconspicuous wood mice which are common to the whole of the Philippines, while the other, more specialized genera are barely ever found outside Luzon. Apomys itself was divided in two groups by American biologist Guy Musser in 1982, the first being the datae group, containing only the Luzon montane forest mouse (A. datae), and the second the abrae-hylocetes group, containing all other species. Animals in these two groups differ in the way in which the head is supplied with blood from arteries. Ruedas placed the large Mindiro forest mouse in the datae group. This relationship is further supported by other similarities: both species are relatively large for the genus and have a relatively long snout.In 2003, a phylogenetic study was published which compared DNA sequences from the cytochrome b gene of thirteen species of Apomys. This study confirmed the proposed relationship between the large Mindoro forest mouse (A. gracilirostris) and the Luzon montane forest mouse (A. datae).[8]The phylogenetic relationships of the large Mindoro forest mouse can be summarized as follows.Chrotomys division	Apomys	datae group	Apomys gracilirostrisApomys dataeabrae-hylocetes group (other species)RhynchomysChrotomysArchboldomysThis study also found that the large Mindoro forest mouse was the only Apomys species that displayed deep within-species divergences, which were calculated to date back some 400.000 years.[8] The split between the large Mindoro forest mouse and the Luzon montane forest mouse dates back further still at an estimated three million years ago, putting it in the Pliocene. Apomys itself in turn was found to date back more than four million years, while the Chromotys division was estimated to go back another two million years.[8] These dates were all calculated using a molecular clock.Another, more elaborate phylogenetic study on all of the endemic Filipino genera and species of Murinae, of which the large Mindoro forest mouse is a member, produced different results. According to this study, the Chromotys division originated some ten million years ago (rather than the estimate of six million years ago from the previous study). It was further calculated that the split between the Chromotys division and its closest relatives, a predominantly African group including Mus, Otomys and Mastomys, had happened about sixteen million years ago.[7] However, since the fossil record of Murinae from the Philippines is non-existent, and controversial for Murinae from other areas, these estimates can only be based on the molecular clock, and not on direct paleontological data.The large Mindoro forest mouse is the third known rodent endemic to Mindoro, after the Mindoro black rat and the Mindoro climbing rat, and not including the Ilin Island cloudrunner, the occurrence of which has not been confirmed on the island. However, in a compilation work on the indigenous mammals of the Philippines, published in 1998, it was announced that there is a second Apomys on Mindoro.[1] This species has yet to be described and has temporarily been given the name of \"Apomys sp. E\". It may be related to two other undescribed species from Sibuyan Island and Greater Negros-Panay, Apomys sp. A/C and Apomys sp. B.[8] The local population of A. musculus, the only other Apomys known on the island, may also represent a separate species.[9] Several other species occur exclusively on Mindoro (in addition to the undescribed Maxomys species mentioned earlier), including Oliver\'s warty pig, the tamaraw and the megabat Styloctenium mindorensis. The relatively large number of endemic species on Mindoro can be explained from the fact that, in all probability, Mindoro was never connected to any other landmass. This enabled the animals present on the island to develop in isolation from their relatives.A remarkable biogeographical aspect of Mindoro is its status as a transition area between Greater Palawan and the rest of the Philippines. On the one hand, species like Oliver\'s warty pig and the tamaraw are clearly related to animals from Greater Palawan and the rest of South-East Asia, but on the other, Mindoro also harbours animals from genera like Apomys and Chrotomys, which are clearly Filipino. The latter animals reached Mindoro from Luzon, or possibly in some cases Greater Negros-panay. The large Mindoro forest mouse, with its close relationship to the Luzon montane forest mouse, probably falls into the group of animals that reached the island from Luzon.[10]Ecology and behaviour[edit]Table 2.

These sites are located at altitudes between 1,255 and 1,900 m (4,117 and 6,234 ft). There is a good possibility, however, that the large Mindoro forest mouse also occurs on other mountains on Mindoro, especially on the northern part of the island, which is home to large areas of undamaged cloud forest.[4]The lowest forests in which the large Mindoro forest mouse has been found, at some 1,250 m (4,100 ft) above sea level, are mostly between 14 and 16 m (46 and 52 ft) in height, with the very tallest reaching 20 m (66 ft). The dominant species of tree are from the genera Leptospermum flavescens, Tristaniopsis and Lithocarpus, from the families Myrtaceae and Fagaceae. These very humid forests have a dense understory vegetation, which consists, amongst other plants, of mosses, tree ferns and species of Pandanus. At higher altitudes (between 1,600 and 1,950 m or 5,250 and 6,400 ft) the forest is dominated by bamboo, while the only tree species present is Agathis philippinensis. Here, vegetation reaches a height between 7 and 10 m (23 and 33 ft). There are many smaller plants present, such as ferns, orchids and species of Pandanus. The forest floor is covered with a layer of leaves with a thickness between 6 and 8 cm (2.4 and 3.1 in).Nothing is known with any certainty about the behaviour of the large Mindoro forest mouse. The long snout, small upper incisors and long lower incisors suggest that the animal feeds on soft invertebrates, but this is not certain. Furthermore, the long tail and elongated hind feet with well-developed claws point towards a climbing lifestyle.Very little is also known about the animal\'s procreation habits. A female specimen was found to carry three embryos. Another female had a swollen uterus, and testicles were visible in several of the male specimens.The Florida mouse (Podomys floridanus) is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae. It is the only species in the genus Podomys, which is the only mammal genus endemic to Florida. The Florida mouse (also known as the big-eared deermouse, the Florida deermouse, and the gopher mouse)[3][4] is found only in a limited area in central peninsular Florida and in one small area in the Florida panhandle. The mouse inhabits some of Florida\'s hottest and driest areas in the high pinelands, sandhills, flatlands, and coastal scrub.The mouse is an omnivore, measures 195 mm (7.7 in) in total length, has relatively large ears, and displays brown to orange upperparts and white underparts. The mouse breeds throughout the year, and raises its two or three young per litter in the nesting chambers and passages it constructs in the burrow of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus). Real estate development and a decline in the gopher tortoise population threaten the mouse\'s future. The species is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN.Contents  [hide] 1	Description2	Taxonomy3	Distribution and habitat4	Behavior4.1	Shelter4.2	Diet4.3	Reproduction4.4	Survival5	Relations with humans and conservation6	ReferencesDescription[edit]The Florida mouse displays a soft and silky pelage, brown above and orange on the cheeks, shoulders, and lower sides. Underparts are white. The young are gray. The species has a skunk-like odor.[5] The mouse has relatively large, nearly naked ears (16 mm long or more), a relatively short tail approximately 80% of total body length, and large hind feet (24 mm long or more) with five, rather than the usual six, plantar tubercles.[2][5] There is no difference in appearance between males and females.[3]The appearance of the Florida mouse is similar to the Peromyscus shown in this illustrationThe mouse looks like Peromyscus, and was once placed as a monotypic subgenus in the genus Peromyscus The greater size and distinctive coloration of Podomys floridanus distinguish it from the cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus) and oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus), which also occur in Florida.[2][5]In 1973, a biochemical polymorphism study was conducted in four sample areas of the species. Electrophoretically demonstrable variation was found in one or more populations at 15 of 39 (38%) of the loci examined, and two and sometimes three alleles per locus were detected. At the least, the findings give an indication of the kind of genetic variation that may be found between populations within a species. The amount of variation was similar to findings in examinations of Peromyscus polionotus, Sigmodon, and Dipodomys.[5]Average measurements reported in 1993 of 30 adults were: total length 195 mm (7.7 in) 178–220 mm (7.0–8.7 in); tail 88 mm (3.5 in) 80–101 mm (3.1–4.0 in); hind foot 26 mm (1.0 in) 24–28 mm (0.94–1.10 in); ear 19 mm (0.75 in) 16–21.5 mm (0.63–0.85 in). The diploid number is 48 and dentition 1/1 0/0 0/0 3/3 total 16.[5]Taxonomy[edit]The mouse was first described by Frank Chapman in 1889 in a paper in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, from a specimen collected at Gainesville, Florida.[6][7] The species was named as a separate subgenus of Peromyscus by Wilfred Hudson Osgood in 1909, but generic recognition was disputed in the 1980s. Michael Carleton and Guy Musser supported the ranking in 1993.[8] No subspecies have been described.[6]Distribution and habitat[edit]Dry places such as sandhills are common habitats for Podomys.Podomys is the only mammal genus endemic only to Florida.[2][5] The Florida mouse is found coast to coast in central peninsular Florida. An isolated population is found in the Florida panhandle at Franklin County, Florida.[2][5] The species occurs from north-central Florida south to Highlands County and Sarasota County. It is found along the Atlantic coast from St. Johns County south to Miami-Dade County.[9]The mouse inhabits some of Florida\'s driest locations. It is common in the sand pine (Pinus clausa) scrub and the high pinelands of turkey oak (Quercus laevis) and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), and is found in the slash pine (Pinus elliottii) and turkey oak habitat of the southern ridge sandhills, and in scrubby flatlands, and in coastal scrub associations.[5] Home ranges average roughly 1 acre (0.40 ha),[1] and are smaller in the flatlands. Populations are greater in the scrub and flatlands than in the highlands.[6] Its largest populations may occur within Ocala National Forest and the scrubs along Lake Wales Ridge.[9]Behavior[edit]The Florida mouse is nocturnal,[3] and is active throughout the year except on especially cold nights.[9] The mouse can climb, but is primarily a terrestrial species. In laboratory experiments, P. floridanus used its forepaws to dig and throw substrate backwards while other species mainly used their hindfeet to do the same.[4]Shelter[edit]Gopher tortoise burrow entranceThe Florida mouse has been called the gopher mouse because it shares the long, deep burrow of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus). The mouse makes nest chambers, small side passages, sometimes a pad of oak leaves and wiregrasses for chamber floors, and small chimney openings in the roof of the burrow. It uses these openings, the main entrance, and side passages for entrance to and exit from the burrow.[10] In the absence of gopher tortoise burrows, the mouse will use those of the oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) or will make its own.[9]Diet[edit]The Florida mouse is an omnivore and its diet consists of acorns when available, insects, seeds, nuts, fungi, and other plant material and vertebrates.[1][11] A 1987 report indicates the mouse feeds on engorged ticks (Ornithodorus turicata americanus) that parasitize gopher frogs (Rana areolata) and gopher tortoises.[11]Reproduction[edit]Florida mice breed throughout the year with a peak between July and December, a lesser peak in January and February, and a lull or cessation in April and May. Unlike most murids, copulatory behavior lacks intravaginal thrusting, the intromission thrust is more intense than the dismount, there is no lock, and ejaculation occurs with every thrust.[4]Gestation is about 23 or 24 days.[12] The mice dig side burrows off the main burrow of the gopher tortoise, line them with shredded plant material, and use them as nurseries.[3] In eight litters of young conceived in the wild but born in the laboratory, litter size numbers varied from two to four for an average of 3.1 per litter.[12] The young are born in nests in the burrow.[1] Newborn weigh 1.9–2.9 g (0.067–0.102 oz) and measure in total length 44 mm (1.7 in); tail length 12 mm (0.47 in); and hind foot length 8 mm (0.31 in). Teeth begin appearing on the fourth day, the young are active and agile about the 10th day, and the eyes open about the 16th day. Nursing is virtually non-stop for the first two weeks of life.[3] Weaning occurs at three to four weeks, and the young display adult behavior at this time.[12]Survival[edit]Ectoparasites are seven species of mites, five ticks, five fleas, a louse, and the subdermal botfly larva, Cuterebra. Known endoparasites are three species of protozoans found in fecal smears, one trematode, four cestodes, seven nematodes, and nymphal pentastomids found in various internal organs.[6]In 2010, exact population size was unknown, but estimated to be in the several thousands and decreasing.[1] Presumed predators are snakes, birds of prey, bobcats, raccoons, and foxes. A high number of shortened tails have been observed in the mice and a modified integument in the tail facilitates tail loss, probably as an anti-predator mechanism.[6]Few wild individuals have a lifespan of over a year, though captive individuals may live for several years.[1] One captive male lived seven years, four months.[6]Relations with humans and conservation[edit]The species in all probability has little or no direct impact or influence on human interests and concerns but agricultural and real estate development are a threat to the species\' very narrow habitat. Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated by the millions of ants which eat the bait in the trap the moment it is set on the ground. Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult if not impossible.[6]As early as 1998, the Florida mouse was a federal C2 candidate taxon, and considered Threatened by the Florida Committee on Rare and Endangered Plants and Animals. The mouse was named a Species of Special Concern by the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.[8] The Florida mouse inhabits a restricted habitat in the United States and that habitat is threatened not only by agricultural and real estate development but by wildfire suppression. Habitat decline is expected to continue into the future.[1][6] The mouse is dependent upon gopher tortoise burrows, but disease and habitat loss are responsible for decline in the tortoise population.[1] Red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) threaten both tortoise and mouse populations. The IUCN has listed the species as Vulnerable and recommends further study of the species, maintenance of viable populations of gopher tortoises, and the preservation and management of suitable habitat for the species.[1] The mouse is protected on several conservation lands across central Florida.[9] Occurrences of the Florida mouse are protected at Archbold Biological Station, Ocala National Forest, and others.[1]The big-eared hopping mouse (Notomys macrotis) is an extinct species of mouse, which lived in the Moore River area of south-western Australia. The big-eared hopping mouse was a small, rat-sized animal resembling a tiny kangaroo. It had large eyes and ears with a brush-tipped tail (Breed and Ford). It moved on its four legs when traveling at a slower pace, or by bounding upon its enlarged, padded, hind feet when traveling quickly. They mainly lived in sand dunes or nests made of leaves and other organic materials, which attributed to the “morphological and physiological adaptations” of the elongated hind feet and brush-tipped tail to increase agility through such an environment (Breed 21). The big-eared hopping mouse was among many hopping mice to be extinct, and its absence from extensive sub-fossil collections suggests it was restricted to Western Australia (Burbidge, 618).Of the six taxa with ranges limited to Western Australia, five are considered threatened or vulnerable and one, the big-eared hopping mouse, is extinct. Under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act of 1950, the hopping mouse is listed as “fauna presumed to be extinct” and under Commonwealth legislation, simply “extinct”. We only know about the hopping mouse from two damaged specimen: one from which the location it was found in is unknown and one at Moore River in Western Australia (Morris and Burbidge,1). The last record dates from 19 July 1843 and was collected in Perth around the Moore River and King George’s Sound by John Gilbert, who was employed by John Gould. Land around the Moore originally consisted of coastal heathland, woodland, and forest (Morris and Burbidge, 1). Gilbert focused primarily on rodent species, but collected several rodent species, including Notomys macrotis. It is known from two damaged specimens held in the Natural History Museum, London. There is speculation as to whether the species was last collected in July 1843, for in the 19th and early 20th centuries there was an absence of scientific data in the area of which the big-eared hopping mouse inhabited. Drying conditions throughout much of the continent of Australia likely account for the relatively poor Miocene fossil record.The Murid rodents likely entered northern Australia from Southeast Asia through relatively dry corridors sometime between 8 and 5 million years ago, during the late Miocene. Perhaps during this period, many modern groups of rodents underwent explosive radiations to produce the high diversity of species lineages that are present today, including the big-eared hopping mouse. The Rodentia order of mammals has an extensive non-Australian representation and almost certainly arrived as diversified groups with closer phylogenetic relationships to non-Australian mammals. During the Pliocene period, directly following the Miocene period, mammal communities In Australia began to change as a result of this fairly recent influx of new orders and families, which would have included the big-eared hopping mouse (Archer, M. et al., 1999).Alternatively, murids may have entered Australia already differentiated into various groups. This potential is, however, limited by the total absence of rodents in the late Miocene Alcoota and Ongeva Local Faunas of the Northern Territory. Currently there is no evidence or scientific method to test these alternative scenarios (Murray, P. and Megirian, D., 1992).Seven species of native Australian rodent have become extinct and several others have significantly declined in numbers since the settlement of Europeans in Australia. These Australian rodents are 48% of the total mammals extinct in Western Africa (Morris). The hopping mouse was probably the first Australian mammal to succumb to European settlers. Hopping mice are vulnerable to agriculture and pastoralism, as well as introduced cats. During a plague, mice can comprise up to 100% of the diet of a feral cat, lending support to the theory that feral cats were the primary cause of their extinction (Dickman, 16). By the 1850s, feral cats inhabited the Western Australian Wheatbelt; however, extinction occurred before the Red Fox came to Western Australia (Burbidge, 618). It had no defenses against Australia\'s introduced species. This mouse\'s extinction can possibly be shown as a ramification of environmental alteration by humans, and predation is another likely possibility, but the true reason for the extinction of the big eared hopping mouse is unknown (Morris and Burbidge,1). The presumed decade of extinction is unknown, but is possibly the 1860s, which was soon after the date of the last known specimen (Burbidge, 618).Australian rodents, not including the big-eared hopping mouse, currently comprise roughly 25% of the modern species-level diversity of terrestrial mammals of the continent.There are many known reasons for the extinction of the big-eared hopping mouse. These factors include; the predation by feral cats, exotic disease, habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as, habitat degradation and the depletion of resources as a result of livestock and feral herbivores. Each of these causal factors are rated with differing levels of “consequence” in effecting the extinction of the big-eared hopping mouse.Feral Cats had a catastrophic influence on the big-eared hopping mouse, as they targeted a number of larger rodents throughout Western Australia in the 1850s. The presence of these feral cats occurred before that of the Red Fox.Exotic disease held a severe to catastrophic position in contributing to the extinction of the big-eared hopping mouse. An epizootic disease had a heavy impact on a large number of mammal species in Western Australia, notomys macrotis included. This disease in conjunction with drought conditions and the presence of feral cats helped lead to the extinction of the big-eared hopping mouse.Habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation all had moderate to severe ratings for the extinction of this species. The big-eared hopping mouse lived in sand dune environments, the same of which were used in the 1800s for sheep herding, as well as mass land clearing. Both of these impacted the condition of the soils, grass, nutrients, leaves, and other organic materials in the mouse’s habitat. The destruction of their burrows, resources, and food supply led to the extinction of this species.In addition to the well known causes for the big-eared hopping mice’s extinction there are other factors that may have influenced its extinction as well. Certain characteristics that the big-eared hopping possessed such as its size, location and nice might have influenced its ultimate extinction. Studies have shown that by comparison animals in Australia have lower resting metabolic rate than those of other animals (Lovegroove ). Studies have also shown that small animals, such as the big-eared hopping mice need high resting metabolic rate to attain the large metabolic scope needed in order to regulate body temperature. Consequently, an animal with a high resting metabolic rate has “reduced mortality and increased longevity and fecundity” (Lovegroove 88). In short the fact that the big-eared hoping mouse lived in a location where animals have a relatively low resting metabolic rate in addition to its need of a high metabolic rate due to its size might have been factors that influences its extinction. Moreover, the niche that the big-eared hopping mice performed may have also lead it down the path of extinction. The big-eared hopping mouse exhibited “morphological or physiological adaptations to their particular way of life” (Breed 5). This typed of mouse had a specialized niche, a characteristic that is labeled as being an extinction promoting trait because “species that were both rare and specialized were especially vulnerable to extinction” (Davies, Margules, Lawrence 267).Within the Notomys genus there exist two clades. The Big Eared Hopping Mouse (Notomys macrotis) is classified in the same clade as the Short Tailed Hopping Mouse (Notomys amplus) and the Great Hopping Mouse (Notomys sp); both of whom are extinct. They are classified together due to their similar size. It also shares similar morphology with the Fawn Hopping Mouse (Notomys cervinus) and the Long Tailed Hopping Mouse (Notomys longicaudatus), due to the fact that they all lack a derived reproductive tract of the Spinifex Hopping Mouse (Notomys alexis) clade (Ford). Its closest phylogenetic relative is probably Notomys cervinus (Wilson and Reeder,1428).The Luzon montane forest mouse (Apomys datae) is a species of rodent in the family Muridae, from the genus Apomys. It occurs only in the Philippines, where it has been found on the large northern island Luzon (in the Cordillera Central and on the coast of Ilocos Norte). It is most closely related to the large Mindoro forest mouse, which occurs on Mindoro. There may be another related species in the Sierra Madre, but this species is yet undescribed. The Luzon montane forest mouse is a relatively large, ground-dwelling rat with a tail that is quite short for its genus.Contents  [hide] 1	Discovery2	Evolution and phylogenetic relationships3	Identification4	Notes and references5	SourcesDiscovery[edit]
